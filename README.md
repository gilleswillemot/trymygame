# trymygame
This is a game that I created by using the MEAN stack for the app (front- and backend), ngbootstrap (javascript) & bootstrap (css) for the layout and the <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5 library<a/> for the game (2D).
<br/>Feel free to try it out <a href="https://trymygame.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">here<a/> and to make adjustments & improvements via pushes to this repository.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running the project locally (dev)
    
    I installed Concurrently (npm i concurrently --save-dev) to run two npm commands in parallel, so
    that I could do "npm start" and my front-end and back-end would launch in development (locally).
